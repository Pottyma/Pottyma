## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a junior Technical Support Engineer with a background in Industrial Mechanics.
For the past year, Iâ€™ve been helping keep production line software and hardware running smoothly at a local plant.

While solving everyday tech issues, I started writing PowerShell and Python scripts to automate repetitive tasks like log collection and system checks.

My goal is to transition into system administration or DevOps in the future, combining my hands-on hardware skills with automation and scripting.

I love creating simple, clean UI mockups in **Figma** and then turning them into real pages with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **a bit of JS**.  
Currently, Iâ€™m building my first personal website to showcase my illustrations and experiment with animations.

Next on my list: learn **React** and make my portfolio fully dynamic!

Letâ€™s connect if you love mixing code and design âœ¨
